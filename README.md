The "I forgot I was supposed to do a readme" readme.
Sorry.
Hopefully the project stays the same on it's journey over the internet to your computer.

To run the simulation:
- Select a scene from the Assets root folder
	- Note: only significant difference between scenes is the map geometry & the spawn points

- Press play
- Hope the thing happens correctly
- Watch the things do their things on screen
	- Neat


- *If the thing doesn't do the thing correctly:*
	- You might need to add some physics layers
		- Terrain (assigned to the stage geometry)
		- Hunter (assigned to the hunters)
		- Food (assigned to... yeah how did you know?)
	- Yell at your computer
		- Sometimes it works, I can't explain it
	- Email me anytime, srs
		- alec@hazardousgiraffe.com
		- I'll help you fix my mistake in no time


To modify/ tweak:
- The "Manager" GameObject in the scene hierarchy contains every modifiable parameter related to the simulation
- Each parameter has been set (by me) but can be changed for some fun, interesting results
	- Try changing the procreation probability to 1!
		- You've never seen your computer work this hard to render a scene, how fun! Computer may be hot the the touch afterwards.
